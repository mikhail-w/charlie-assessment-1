# Twoge Deployment on AWS

Twoge is a social media platform where users can share their thoughts
exclusively about Doge. This project was developed and deployed using various
AWS services to ensure scalability, security, and efficiency.

## Project Overview

As part of the Codeplatoon DevOps team, the goal was to deploy Twoge on AWS,
utilizing services like:

- Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
- Simple Storage Service (S3)
- Identity Access Management (IAM)
- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
- Simple Notification Service (SNS)

Below are the completed milestones, architecture diagram, and documentation for
the deployment process.

## Milestones

### 1. Amazon VPC with Public Subnets

- Created a VPC with two public subnets.

### 2. Host Static Files on S3

- Created an S3 bucket to store static files like images and videos.
- Configured the bucket for public read access.

### 3. IAM Role for S3 Access

- Created an IAM role that grants the required permissions for the EC2 instance
  to access the S3 bucket.

### 4. EC2 Instance Deployment

- Launched an EC2 instance using Ubuntu Linux AMI.
- Installed and configured the Twoge application on the EC2 instance.

### 5. Application Load Balancer (ALB)

- Created an ALB to distribute incoming traffic across EC2 instances.
- Configured an HTTP listener rule to forward traffic to the EC2 instances.

### 6. Auto Scaling Group (ASG)

- Created an ASG to automatically scale the number of EC2 instances based on
  traffic demand.
- Integrated the ASG with the ALB for seamless load balancing.

### 7. Simple Notification Service (SNS)

- Configured an SNS topic to send email notifications about ASG scaling
  activities.
- Set up SNS to notify when EC2 instances are added or removed from the ASG.

### 8. Server Shutdown Notifications

- Demonstrated SNS email notifications upon server shutdown.

### 9. Stress Test with ASG Scaling

- Ran a Python-based stress test to simulate high traffic.
- Observed and showcased the ASG scaling in action as new instances were
  launched and terminated.

## Architecture Diagram

![Architecture Diagram](images/twoge-architecture-diagram.png)

The architecture includes:

- A secure VPC with public subnets in 2 availability zones.
- IAM policy for serviceâ€™s access and permissions management.
- S3 bucket for static file hosting.
- EC2 instances managed by an ASG and ALB.
- RDS for private database hosting.
- SNS for notifications.

## Commands and Configuration Files

### Terminal Commands

Detailed commands for each step can be found below.

### S3 Bucket Policy

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mikhail-twoge-static-files/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### IAM Role policy

Provides full access to all buckets via the AWS Management Console.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:*", "s3-object-lambda:*"],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Nginx Configuration

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9876;
        proxy_set_header Host \$host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP \$remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For \$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```
